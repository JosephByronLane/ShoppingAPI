# Corrected gear ratios
# From Gear 1 to Gear 2 (driver to driven): 20/60
# From Gear 2 to Gear 3 (driver to driven): 60/36
# From Gear 3 to Gear 4 (driver to driven): 36/20 (Since Gear 3 and Gear 4 share the same axis, this ratio is effectively the ratio of their teeth)

# Correct gear ratio from Gear 2 to Gear 3
ratio_gear2_to_gear3_corrected = teeth_gear2 / teeth_gear3

# Correct final gear ratio
final_gear_ratio_corrected = ratio_gear1_to_gear2 * ratio_gear2_to_gear3_corrected * ratio_gear3_to_gear4

# Correct total rotations of the T screw when Gear 1 spins 6 times
total_rotations_t_screw_corrected = spins_gear1 / final_gear_ratio_corrected

# Correct total linear movement of Gear 5 is the number of rotations of the T screw times the pitch
total_linear_movement_gear5_corrected = total_rotations_t_screw_corrected * pitch_t_screw

total_linear_movement_gear5_corrected
